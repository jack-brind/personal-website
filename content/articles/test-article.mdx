Good typography is invisible when it works and exhausting when it doesn’t.
A well-designed typographic scale creates rhythm, hierarchy, and clarity — helping readers understand content without thinking about _how_ they’re reading it.

Typography isn’t decoration. It’s infrastructure.

# Hierarchy creates understanding

When headings clearly differ from body text — in size, weight, and spacing — readers can scan confidently.

Poor hierarchy forces users to **read everything** to understand anything.

## Clear hierarchy helps readers:

- Understand structure at a glance
- Jump to relevant sections quickly
- Maintain orientation in long documents
- Reduce cognitive load

A typographic scale should feel _predictable_, not surprising.

# Accessibility starts with legibility

Legibility is not just about font choice — it’s about scale, contrast, and spacing working together.

> Accessibility isn’t a “mode” you turn on later.  
> It’s the outcome of good defaults.

Key considerations include:

1. Adequate font size for body text
2. Comfortable line length
3. Sufficient line height
4. Clear contrast between text and background

If users have to zoom, squint, or concentrate to read, the system has already failed them.

# Body text does most of the work

Headlines attract attention, but body text carries meaning.

Well-set body text should:

- Disappear visually
- Maintain a steady reading rhythm
- Avoid extreme contrast or tight spacing

This is why **consistency matters more than flair**.

---

# Inline emphasis and code

Good systems account for small interruptions in the flow of reading.

Inline code like `line-height: 1.6` should feel integrated, not jarring.  
The same applies to emphasis, links, and abbreviations.

A sentence might include a reference to `font-feature-settings` or a variable like `--fg-primary`, and it should still read naturally.

---

# Code blocks need breathing room

Longer code samples should clearly separate themselves from prose:

```css
body {
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: var(--fg-primary);
}
```
